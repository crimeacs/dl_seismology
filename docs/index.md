## DLS

This page contains the database and interactive plots for ... paper. 

You can modify or add your paper information into the database trough a ***pull request***. 
To do so follow these steps:

1. Fork the [dl_seismology](https://github.com/smousavi05/dl_seismology)
2. Create your feature branch (git checkout -b my-new-feature)
3. Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add some feature'). You can use GitHub editor directly to change the CSV
4. Push to the branch (git push origin my-new-feature)
5. Create a new Pull Request

		"notes": "The main contribution of this paper is the use of U-Net. The prediction in the model space has dimensions of 201# 301; interestingly, the spatial                  dimensions of the input coincide with the second spatial dimension of the predictions, which is basically the number of receivers per shot. The U-                Net architecture on the encoder side is composed by 10 2D convolutional layers interleaved with batch normalization and using ReLU as the                        activation function. For connecting layers, every two 2D convolutional layers are placed between the encoder and decoder. The decoder section is                  composed of eight 2D convolutional layers and interleaved with the corresponding deconvolution layers. The ADAM optimizer is using during                        training, with two different numbers of epochs, depending on which data set is used as input, learning rate, and batch size constant. Results are                presented as the comparison between the CNN predictions and a MS-FWI solver, for which the starting model is a smoothed version of the ground                    truth. The first set of results (for a CNN trained with synthetic data) presented is competitive with FWI solutions; the salt bodies are                         identified and properly placed, but the boundaries are less continuous than the FWI solution, as can observed in Figure 12(c)."
