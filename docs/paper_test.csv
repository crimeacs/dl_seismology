The method relies on Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) and supervised learning to improve the detection capabilities at 3C seismic stations. A time-frequency decomposition provides the basis for the required signal characteristics we need in order to derive the features defining typical ‘‘signal’’ and ‘‘noise’’ patterns. Each pattern class is modeled by a DBN, specifying the interrelationships of the derived features in the time-frequency plane. Subsequently, the models are trained using previously labeled segments of seismic data. The DBN models can now be compared against in order to determine the likelihood of new incoming seismic waveform segments to be either signal or noise."

In the first step, a kernel convolution followed by a max pooling operation is used to automatically extract features from short windows of 3C waveforms recorded by each station and reducing their dimension. This step can be viewed as a station-level data compression. In the next step, a graph-partitioning method is used to divide the seismic stations into a few clusters of presumably more correlated stations based on their adjacency in a graph representation, and then extracted features from stations in each cluster are aggregated to perform a network-level compression. This compact representation of seismic observation across the array in the feature space, is then used by the subsequent layers of the neural network for reasoning and classifying the observation as either earthquake or non-earthquake event. The core idea is that the observed waveforms at nearby stations correlate with each other in the feature space, thus by stacking (average pooling) of them and improving the feature representation, the performance could be improved as opposed to naive multi-station deep-learning approaches. The method seems to be not very flexible with the number and geometry of the stations, depending on the event-station distributions, and the hyperparameters used for graph partitioning."
